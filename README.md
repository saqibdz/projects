# Programing Fundamental Project



Project Title: Personal Finance Tracker

Project Description:

This project aims to create a basic personal finance tracker in Python. The tool allows users to input their income and expenses, and it calculates and displays a summary of their financial situation.

Key Components:

PersonalFinanceTracker Class:

The project defines a Python class called PersonalFinanceTracker. This class encapsulates the user's financial data and includes methods for adding income, adding expenses, calculating the balance, and displaying a summary.

Income and Expenses:

Users can input their income by specifying an amount, and this is added to their overall income.
Expenses can be added with a category and an amount. These expenses are stored in a list, allowing users to track multiple expenses.

Balance Calculation:

The tool calculates the balance by subtracting the total expenses from the income. It ensures users have an overview of their financial situation.
User Interaction:

The program is interactive, with a menu-driven interface. Users can choose to add income, add expenses, view a summary, or exit the program.
Usage:

  The Personal Finance Tracker operates as follows:

  Users launch the program.

  They have the option to add income, which increases their total income.

  They can add expenses by specifying a category and amount, allowing them to record different types of spending.
  
  The tool calculates and displays the balance by subtracting total expenses from the income.

  Users can view a summary of their financial situation.

  The program runs until the user chooses to quit.

  This project serves as a simple introduction to programming fundamentals, including class creation, data storage, user input handling, and basic calculations. 

  It provides users with a straightforward means of tracking their finances. Further enhancements could be made to improve data persistence, add date tracking for      expenses, and create more advanced features.

# Object-oriented programming (OOP) Project

Project Description: Blogging Platform with OOP

Objective: The project's main goal is to create a blogging platform where users can write and manage blog posts, comment on posts, and view a list of posts and their associated comments.

Components:

Author Class: Represents individuals who write blog posts. Authors have names.

Comment Class: Represents comments made on blog posts. Each comment has an author and content.

Post Class: Represents individual blog posts with a title, content, and an author. Posts can also have comments.

Blog Class: Represents the overall blogging platform. It allows the creation of new posts, lists all posts, and displays comments for each post.

User Interaction: The project simulates user interactions where authors (in this case, "Alice" and "Bob") can create blog posts and readers can comment on those posts. Users can also view the list of posts and associated comments.

Output: The project provides output in the form of blog posts, comments, and a summary of the blog's name, the number of posts, and a list of authors.

Purpose: This project is designed to showcase the application of OOP principles to create an organized and structured system for managing a blog, its posts, comments, and authors.
