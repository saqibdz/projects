# Programing Fundamental Project



# Project Title: Personal Finance Tracker

# Project Description:

This project aims to create a basic personal finance tracker in Python. The tool allows users to input their income and expenses, and it calculates and displays a summary of their financial situation.

# Key Components:

# PersonalFinanceTracker Class:

The project defines a Python class called PersonalFinanceTracker. This class encapsulates the user's financial data and includes methods for adding income, adding expenses, calculating the balance, and displaying a summary.
# Income and Expenses:

Users can input their income by specifying an amount, and this is added to their overall income.
Expenses can be added with a category and an amount. These expenses are stored in a list, allowing users to track multiple expenses.
# Balance Calculation:

The tool calculates the balance by subtracting the total expenses from the income. It ensures users have an overview of their financial situation.
User Interaction:

The program is interactive, with a menu-driven interface. Users can choose to add income, add expenses, view a summary, or exit the program.
Usage:

# The Personal Finance Tracker operates as follows:

Users launch the program.
They have the option to add income, which increases their total income.
They can add expenses by specifying a category and amount, allowing them to record different types of spending.
The tool calculates and displays the balance by subtracting total expenses from the income.
Users can view a summary of their financial situation.
The program runs until the user chooses to quit.
This project serves as a simple introduction to programming fundamentals, including class creation, data storage, user input handling, and basic calculations. It provides users with a straightforward means of tracking their finances. Further enhancements could be made to improve data persistence, add date tracking for expenses, and create more advanced features.
